# Weather Forecast Site
## Introduction

Welcome to my **weather forecast site**. This site allows you to **search for a specific location** and toggle the display of the data between Fahrenheit and Celsius. The site's appearance will change based on the weather data, by changing the background image that describe the weather. Both **Promises** and **Async/Await** have been utilized in the code to ensure efficient and seamless performance.

## API Keys, Secrets and Security

In order to provide up-to-date and accurate weather information, this site utilizes API from a trusted source. However, it is important to note that not all APIs are free and can cost money per use. To ensure the security of API usage and prevent unauthorized access, the API keys are stored on the server and never sent to the frontend. This is often done using environment variables, making the key only available on the server where the code is deployed.
